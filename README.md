# Setlister

Setlister is an Android app for people who like music and like going to see live music acts. Setlister makes it easy to prepare for any
gig you are planning on going to. Setlister creates playlists on your phone based on what songs an artist has played in their last show.

Setlister is available on the Google Play store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=setlister.android.owendoyle.com.setlister&hl=en" target="_blank">Here</a>

The information used to create these playlists is taken from
<a href="http://www.setlist.fm/" target="_blank">setlist.fm</a>
 

At the moment Setlister only works if you have the songs on your phone. In a later version of the app the ability to make playlists on 
spotify will be added.
